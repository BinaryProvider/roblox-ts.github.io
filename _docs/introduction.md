Welcome to the **roblox-ts** docs!

**roblox-ts** aims to have feature parity with [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) where possible. However, a few features are not supported due to constraints when compiling to Lua.

When writing code with **roblox-ts**, all Lua built-in functions and APIs are available as well as the entire Roblox API.

This wiki contains a list of articles specific to **roblox-ts** usage. If you're looking for more general TypeScript information, please refer to the [TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html).
