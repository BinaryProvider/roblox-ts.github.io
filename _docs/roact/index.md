description: A manual for using the view management library Roact with roblox-ts.
---
Roact is a library that is natively supported by `roblox-ts`.  Roact is a declarative Lua UI library similar to Facebook's React. It exposes a very similar API and implements nearly identical semantics. TypeScript Roact includes JSX support as well as native typescript classes.

# Requirements
Roact requires you have the `rbx-roact` package installed.

This can be achieved by doing `npm i rbx-roact` on your project.

Roact can then be imported as such:
```ts
import * as Roact from "rbx-roact"; // recommended method
```

See the left side for more information on how to use Roact with TypeScript.
