Typescript Roact requires that you have [roblox-ts](https://github.com/roblox-ts/roblox-ts) as well as [rbx-types](https://github.com/roblox-ts/rbx-types) installed.

# Install via `NPM`
- Run the command `npm i rbx-roact`.

You're done. You can now use it by importing Roact in files you wish to use it in:
```ts
import * as Roact from "Roact";
```
